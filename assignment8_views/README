ASSIGNMENT 8 SUBMISSION: 

Our customers did not request any changes from us, apart from us forgetting to provide
them with a Directions enum for the controller interface. 

Below is the README we sent to them explaining our view.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features of our view:
- Selecting cells: The user can select a cell just by clicking on it.
- Editing the selected cell: If a user has selected a cell, they can input a value or formula into
  the text field at the bottom and press "edit cell" or enter on their keyboard to make the edit
  occur. They can also click "clear edit" to clear the text field.
- Deleting the selected cell: The user can click on a cell and press delete or backspace on their
  computer to clear the contents of a cell.
- Moving the highlighted cell: The user can user arrow keys to move the highlighted cell. As a side
  note, we did not figure out how to make this work with scrolling, so the user can move the
  highlighted cell out of the field of view (but it is still there).
- Increase size: The user can increase the size of the spreadsheet as many times as they want by
  clicking "Increase size". This button resets the view to the top left which helped deal with a bug
  involving drawing text over the toolbar (this feature is completely internal to the view).
- Saving a file: The user can use the menu at the top to save the current spreadsheet as a text file
  at their preferred directory.
- Loading a file: The user can load a spreadsheet text file into a visual edit view also utilizing
  the same menu.
